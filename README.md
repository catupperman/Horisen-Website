# Horisen-Website
**This was a "Clean it up" Project.** 

_First Step: Trouble shoot Commits onto GitHub:_
I inteded to attatch more commits, than what is shown.  I was having some trouble with the terminal end, but was able to figure it out towards the end of the project.  I now realize the process of `git commit -m quote`, commits it to my internal, and then `git add`, commits it to the website, and then, finally, `git push` is the final commit to "push" it onto my GitHub. This discovery was made after several google attempts, with trial and error.  In the future, I will ensure a commit after each major change, now that I have a better understanding of the concept.  

**_The Project Itself_**
  
The initial code had several repeats within the CSS, which I condensed.  Within the HTML, several divs were discovered that could be condensed into one.  I took my time running the code back and forth to make sure the adjustments did not affect the integrity of the original website.

I adjusted some measurements to allow for the boxes to align with each other at the bottom of the website, when viewed on a full computer screen. I also added a title to the web page within the HTML to showcase the name of the company when a user opens the page.
